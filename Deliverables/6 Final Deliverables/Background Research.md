## New York Botanical Garden: The Organization, its mission and goals

### Organization:

The New York Botanical Garden (NYBG) is a National Historical Landmark located in the Bronx, New York City. The site covers 250 acre which is a landscape that supports a diverse flora of millions of plants. (Mission and History, n.d.)

According the NYBG official website; “the New York Botanical Garden is an iconic living museum, a major educational institution, and a renowned plant research and conservation organization. Founded in 1891 and now a National Historic Landmark, it is one of the greatest botanical gardens in the world and the largest in any city in the United States, distinguished by the beauty of its diverse landscape and extensive collections and gardens, as well as by the scope and excellence of its multidisciplinary exhibitions and programs.” (About, n.d.)

NYBG is committed truly committed to the local communities. Throughout the year the garden participate in innovative exhibitions and have several free visitor attractions.  For instance, every year in the spring, the Garden  has  “The Orchid Show, the country’s largest curated exhibition of orchids”. In the winter, they have the “Holiday Train Show” which is “a display of 150 landmarks such as the Brooklyn Bridge, Statue of Liberty, and Rockefeller Center, each re-created with bark, leaves, and other natural materials” (Arts & Humanities, n.d.).  Furthermore the garden is very committed to educating the public which enhance the visitor’s experience. “These include music and dance performances; daily tours; home gardening demonstrations; poetry readings; special lectures and symposia; summer concerts; weekend celebrations such as the Daffodil Wine Weekend, Mother’s Day Weekend Garden Party, and Rose Garden Celebration; and evening events, including Orchid Evenings and Bar Car Nights.” (Arts & Humanities, n.d.).

According the NYGB website; their “Adult Education Program is the largest and most diverse continuing education program at any botanical garden in the world, with annual registrations exceeding 9,400 and more than 700 classes offered at the Botanical Garden, the Midtown Education Center in Manhattan, and off-site locations in Dutchess County and Connecticut.” (Arts & Humanities, n.d.) . The Garden also has a nationally accredited School of Professional Horticulture, established in 1932 which offers a two-year, full-time diploma program in horticulture, botany, and landscape design, including native plants, green roofs, urban agriculture, sustainability, greenhouse management, and ecological garden design. (Arts & Humanities, n.d.)  

### Mission: 

“The New York Botanical Garden is an advocate for the plant kingdom. The Garden pursues its mission through its role as a museum of living plant collections arranged in gardens and landscapes across its National Historic Landmark site; through its comprehensive education programs in horticulture and plant science; and through the wide-ranging research programs of the International Plant Science Center”. (Mission and History, n.d.)

### Goals:  

“On May 24, 1895 the northern portion of Bronx Park was chosen as the site of the Garden. In 1898, the first checklist of plants living on the Grounds was published in the Journal of The New York Botanical Garden.” (Natural History of the Forest, n.d.)

The goal of the NYBG has been, since its humble beginnings, to save the plants of the world. Per the Garden website: “NYBG pursues science-based plant conservation, providing fundamental research to support policy decisions made by governments on local, national, and international scales. Its efforts have helped to protect some of the most threatened floras in the world.” (Saving the Plants of the World, n.d.). 

With the current state of our world’s ecology, NYBG is committed to saving the plants worldwide by scaling up its conservation action. The Garden has scientists that are in “250 international collaborations with 168 institutions in 49 countries” (Saving the Plants of the World, n.d.); an enormous conservation commitment and undertaking. 

Since its inception, “the Garden staff, visiting experts, and enthusiastic members of the public have studied the history, wildlife, plant life, geology, climate, soils, and ecology of the Garden. All of these studies have been performed separately and have never been documented in one place. As part of the new Forest Program, Garden staff and visiting experts are creating a Natural History of The New York Botanical Garden to document the physical setting, biota, ecology, management, and ethnobotany of the site. The site is defined as all natural areas within the Garden including the Forest, Twin Lakes, South Arboretum, portion of land between the Rose Garden and Bronx River Parkway perimeter fence, rock outcrops, etc. The goal is to study spontaneous nature at the Garden.” (Natural History of the Forest, n.d.)

This is one of the reason why the Garden has the Thain Family Forest Conversation Program. According to the NYBG website; “the Thain Family Forest is a living laboratory that has several ongoing research projects with the goals of understanding the impacts of the urban environment on the Forest and evaluating ecological restoration projects. Research in the Forest is conducted by staff, students, and volunteers.” (Forest Program Research, n.d.)

According to Jessica Schuler (Director of the New York Botanical Garden), the Thain Family urban forest is an old growth forest. An old growth forest, (Old-growth forest, 2018) “is a forest that has attained great age without major disturbance and there has unique ecological characteristics.” (Old-growth forest, 2018). It’s also called “virgin” forest or “primeval” forest”. 

For a several years now, since 1937 in some cases, the Garden has been conducted some restoration work in the forest alongside with other forest management activities as well. The Forest Inventory Transect Study which data we are reviewing, involves data collection since 2001. According to the Garden website; “Garden staff have been sampling fourteen, 10-meter wide transects across the Forest from the western boundary to the Bronx River. The data collected includes all trees and shrubs that are 1 cm or greater in diameter at breast height (DBH at 4.5 feet) and herbaceous plants and tree seedling percent cover.” (Forest Program Research, n.d.)

The Garden, while gleaning into the data they have been collecting, is interesting in knowing whether or not there are changes to the inventory which consists of data collected about the woody plant in the forest, as well ground cover species. Additionally, there is a systematic effort in place to track invasive plant management, and to help prioritize ongoing restoration work such as native plant restoration. Results from 2011 data according to the Garden official site show that “the Amur honeysuckle and Amur corktree management has been successful in removing the largest specimens but, there are still small Amur corktree present in the Forest. The biggest focus of management recently was derived from these data, the Japanese angelica tree is currently on the rise and the Forest staff is focusing management efforts on this species.” (Forest Program Research, n.d.)



## The Study of Organism and Phenomenon

### <u>Introduction:</u>

Thain Family Forest at the New York Botanical Garden (NYBG) is located in Bronx, New York. The forest is a 50-acre plot of trees and is recorded as the largest surviving old-growth forest remnant (https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/thain-family-forest). Since the year 1895, when the New York Botanical Garden was first set up, the forest has undergone many changes, for instance, in the earlier days, the forest was known as "Hemlock Grove" due to the larger concentration of a particular kind of plant type called Canadian Hemlock. However, the concentration of Canadian Hemlock stared decreasing, when they compared the growth from the northern forest, in the year 1923. Since then, the observers has registered the decline of the growth of Canadian Hemlock from the data entries of years 1937, 2002, 2006 and 2011. This was one such instance of growth change documented by the team of observers in New York Botanical Garden.

### <u>Project Goals</u>:

1. The objective of this project is to understand the impact of climate change on the forest
2. Document the changes to compare the results with the data set of previous years
3. Understanding the impact of invasive species on the native species

### <u>New York Botanical Garden Project</u>:

The study done by New York Botanical Garden (NYBG) is a study of both organisms and phenomenon. As the project revolves around the studying the nature of trees, herbs, shrubs, vines and on recording the impact of the change in climatic conditions as well as other factors such as increase in population density and decrease in forest areas. The project's objective is to restore the forest. They are using various techniques to help gather the records and maintain them. They also take help from volunteers who can forest conservation enthusiasts, who volunteers to observe the forest areas and document their observations. This program is known as **"Citizen Science Program"** https://www.nybg.org/plant-research-and-conservation/center-for-conservation-strategy/get-involved/. 

### <u>Initial Analysis</u>:

Based on the initial analysis of data, we were able to conclude that the facility has been collecting data starting from year 2002. The data they shared was of years 2002, 2006, 2011 and 2016. The data is gathered for Woody Plants, Comprehensive Species and Other Species that can be either invasive or native species. NYBG also have data set from year 1932. With the help of the observations they were able to draw some conclusions. NYBG has provided various references where they have explained he impacts of climate change and other factors.

#### 1. <u>Publication and Research</u>: 

1. In the report, Torreya Forty -eight years of canopy change in hardwood-hemlock forest in New York City. James L. Rudnicky and Mark J. McDonnell. Institute of Ecosystem Studies, NYBG. were able to present the conclusions from various researchers who suggested that in 1982, the composition of the Thain forest compared to 1949 and 1980 vegetation data from Greenbrook Sanctuary, Hoboken NJ found out that major community of plants - oaks, hemlock-hardwood and swamp-hardwood similar in composition. However, the canopy from year 1980 was more homogeneous s comapred to 1949. The author at last concluded that the forest was undergoing  changes to recover from the disturbance to become more uniform. They were able to understand the impact. However, they failed to understand the pattern of the change.

2. The another study was conducted and documented in year 1974, where they studied the impact of temperature impact on the areas of the forest. For example - the climate in the summer is warm and humid, cold during winters. The study was done in Central Park Observatory that is situated at 10 miles south to NYBG. The Average annual temperature is 12. 5 degree Celsius.

   During the year of 1930s the study was subjected to numerous errors in the observations recorded. Due to the much larger part of forest was surveyed than it is done now. However, the vegetation type could be identified by the data collected from 1930s. 

3. Dominant species from year 1930 and 1980 varied. In 1930s the dominant species were in much larger number but their number reduced in year 1985. 

4. Study Area - The area where the study has been conducted plays a very significant role. The temperature and humidity may vary. 

5. Results: The results are compared with the data sets collected from previous years.



## The kind of decisions, interventions, or actions that analysis results could support (e.g., management actions, advocacy for policy changes, etc.)

The New York Botanical Garden is the largest uncut expanse of New York's wooden landscape (NYBG, Retrieved 2018). The garden manages invasive species, native plants and performs research on them. Event though, the forest has remained intact since the ice age, it has undergone many changes due to disturbances from the nature as well as human intervention. 

The forest was originally known as 'Hemlock Grove' because the eastern stand, closest to the Bronx River was dominated by the Canadian Hemlock (NYBG/125, 2016). In 1923, it was observed that that there is a decrease in natural regeneration of the Canadian Hemlock (Tsuga canadensis). Later in 1985, Hurricane Gloria introduced the Hemlock Wooly Adelgid (Adelges tsugae), which infected the forest to further decease the density of the native species. 

The recent changes (1937 to 2018) in the forest has been well documented and hence has helped in studying the factors that have lead to the decrease in the native species. The invasive species have also been well studied and managed by the Forest Management. There has been efforts to restore the forest, and to manage the overall ecosystem to prevent the invasive species from becoming the dominant species. 

> By studying this data we aim to draw the inference between the restoration initiatives and its impact on the forest composition over time.

From the raw data of 2002 and 2006, it was found out that there was a prominent increase in the number of invasive species - Amur Cocktree (Phellodendron amurense), Japanese angelica tree (Aralia elata) and Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii). Since 2008, the Garden has been actively managing these species in order to reduce their impact on the overall ecosystem (NYBG/125, 2016).

> We aim to analyze the change in the number of the controlled invasive species after the intervention of the Garden management, to see if there is a correlation between the two.

Over time, the large openings created by hurricanes, supported the growth of shade intolerant species, where as smaller openings prompted the growth of shade tolerant species. Similarly, there have been other influences which has led a small but important change in the composition of the NYBG Forest.

> We want to study the Canopy changes over the year, to analyze the traits that have led to the survival of a particular species over the others which have reduced in numbers.

Tsuga canadensis and Quercus spp. were the most important species in both 1937 and 1985. There has been an increase in the number of stems in the category 15 cm - 30 cm over the past 48 years (Rudnicky and McDonnell, 1989). In case of T. Canadensis, there has been a significant restoration process that might have impacted the growth. But, what about the species that have prevailed over time with minimal intervention.

> We want to analyze the species that have prevailed during the research period, irrespective of the intervention by the Garden Management. If possible, we would also try to find the factors that may have resulted in this behavior.

In the same 48 year time period it was also observed that the canopy structure of the NYBG Forest has changed from the being dominated by taller trees to now being dominated by shorter ones (Rudnicky and McDonnell, 1989). This period also recorded multiple hurricanes which might be the cause for this behavior. There were hurricanes in 1938, 1944 and 1950, and the taller trees were blown away. Event though there are no records of the forest structure during that period, we might be able to compare the 1937 data with the 2002 data to see traces of the impact of the phenomenon.

> We would be analyzing the change in forest structure pre and post the recorded hurricanes, i.e. 1937 data and the 2002 data, and would try to see the variation of taller trees during this period.

Between 2008 and 2015, the director of NYBG developed an ambitious program of ecological restoration, trail restoration and other programs. There were full time positions of dedicated to restoration activities which included removal of invasive species, planting native species grown from locally collected seeds, managing invasive pests and diseases and restoring the habitat (Schuler and Forrest, 2016). The forest staffs, contractors, and volunteers dedicated a substantial amount of time ~ 24000 hours from 2008 to 2014. 

> We want to analyze the staff hours distribution during this period, and the impact it had towards the area of - restoration planting, invasive plant management and trail maintenance.

Overall, by analyzing the data we have a better understanding of the aims and ambition of the NYBG, and we have ample data to support our analysis. Based on our initial analysis, we had targeted to answer the below questions-

1. How restoration of the plants have impacted the overall growth from 2007 to 2018.
2. How a specific species which was at the brink of extinction flourished due to the restoration efforts.
3. The change in ratio of primitive species VS invasive species, due to restoration process
4. Number of species which had significant difference due to the efforts.
5. Number of species, which did not get much affected by the restoration efforts.
6. Trend of species which were not a part of restoration process
7. Trend of species which have been impacted by the restoration process (can be a duplicate)
8. The different types of species in the restoration process

I think, by a better understanding of the context, we can use incorporate the questions that we have added in this report into the existing ones, to make a more meaningful analysis.
