## Audience

The **New York Botanical Garden (NYBG)** is a National Historical Landmark located in the Bronx, New York City. The site covers 250 acre which is a landscape that supports a diverse flora of millions of plants. (Mission and History, n.d.)

According the NYBG official website; “the New York Botanical Garden is an iconic living museum, a major educational institution, and a renowned plant research and conservation organization. Founded in 1891 and now a National Historic Landmark, it is one of the greatest botanical gardens in the world and the largest in any city in the United States, distinguished by the beauty of its diverse landscape and extensive collections and gardens, as well as by the scope and excellence of its multidisciplinary exhibitions and programs.” (About, n.d.)

NYBG is committed truly committed to the local communities. Throughout the year the garden participate in innovative exhibitions and have several free visitor attractions. For instance, every year in the spring, the Garden has “The Orchid Show, the country’s largest curated exhibition of orchids”. In the winter, they have the “Holiday Train Show” which is “a display of 150 landmarks such as the Brooklyn Bridge, Statue of Liberty, and Rockefeller Center, each re-created with bark, leaves, and other natural materials” (Arts & Humanities, n.d.). Furthermore the garden is very committed to educating the public which enhance the visitor’s experience. “These include music and dance performances; daily tours; home gardening demonstrations; poetry readings; special lectures and symposia; summer concerts; weekend celebrations such as the Daffodil Wine Weekend, Mother’s Day Weekend Garden Party, and Rose Garden Celebration; and evening events, including Orchid Evenings and Bar Car Nights.” (Arts & Humanities, n.d.).

According the NYGB website; their “Adult Education Program is the largest and most diverse continuing education program at any botanical garden in the world, with annual registrations exceeding 9,400 and more than 700 classes offered at the Botanical Garden, the Midtown Education Center in Manhattan, and off-site locations in Dutchess County and Connecticut.” (Arts & Humanities, n.d.) . The Garden also has a nationally accredited School of Professional Horticulture, established in 1932 which offers a two-year, full-time diploma program in horticulture, botany, and landscape design, including native plants, green roofs, urban agriculture, sustainability, greenhouse management, and ecological garden design. (Arts & Humanities, n.d.)

### Decisions that our analysis target

The recent changes (1937 to 2018) in the forest has been well documented and hence has helped in studying the factors that have lead to the decrease in the native species. The invasive species have also been well studied and managed by the Forest Management. There has been efforts to restore the forest, and to manage the overall ecosystem to prevent the invasive species from becoming the dominant species. 

> By studying this data we aim to draw the inference between the restoration initiatives and its impact on the forest composition over time.

From the raw data of 2002 and 2006, it was found out that there was a prominent increase in the number of invasive species - Amur Cocktree (Phellodendron amurense), Japanese angelica tree (Aralia elata) and Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii). Since 2008, the Garden has been actively managing these species in order to reduce their impact on the overall ecosystem (NYBG/125, 2016).

> We aim to analyze the change in the number of the controlled invasive species after the intervention of the Garden management, to see if there is a correlation between the two.

Between 2008 and 2015, the director of NYBG developed an ambitious program of ecological restoration, trail restoration and other programs. There were full time positions of dedicated to restoration activities which included removal of invasive species, planting native species grown from locally collected seeds, managing invasive pests and diseases and restoring the habitat (Schuler and Forrest, 2016). The forest staffs, contractors, and volunteers dedicated a substantial amount of time ~ 24000 hours from 2008 to 2014. 

> We want to analyze the staff hours distribution during this period, and the impact it had towards the area of - restoration planting, invasive plant management and trail maintenance.
