# 1. Inventory Data
## Woody plant

The data in this folder covers the year 1937, 2002, 2006, 2011, 2016

* Useful findings
	* Taxon is a code used that can be referenced back to the _NYBG Species Code Master List JAS12002016_ and show the species Latin names (This is the combination the Genus and Specific epithet columns)

*  1937  
File appears to be correct

* 2002  
	* 1305 specimen were collected and recorded on the following attributes
		* Transect number
		* Plot number
		* Origin
		* Genus
		* Specific epithet
		* Taxon
		* dbh.cm
		* tree.ba.sq.cm  
* 2006  

	* 4624 specimen were collected and recorded on the following attributes
		* Transect number
		* Plot number
		* Origin
		* Genus
		* Specific epithet
		* Taxon
		* dbh.cm
		* tree.ba.sq.cm  

* 2011 - There is a 5 year gap/interval now, previous interval was 4 year and additional attributes are being recorded

	* 5690 specimen were collected and recorded on the following attributes
		* Transect number
		* Plot number
		* Origin (**NOT SURE BUT appears to now been renamed N/S  and seem to only be recording N and S. WHY???**)
		* Genus
		* Specific epithet
		* Taxon
		* dbh.cm
		* tree.ba.sq.cm (**Now BA**)
		*  (#Tree) Tree Number?
		* Vigor
		* Stem
		* S/D/C (**What is this exactly???**)
		* Plot

* 2016 - The new5 year gap/interval continues and even more additional attributes are being recorded

	* 7360 specimen were collected and recorded on the following attributes
		* Transect number
		* Plot number
		* N/S (**What is this exactly??? Now recording N,S and M. WHY???**)
		* Genus
		* Specific epithet
		* dbh.cm
		*  Tree Number
		* Tree Vigor
		* Stem Number
		* S/D/C  (**What is this exactly??? Now appears to have been renamed Crown Class**)
		* _**Plot slope**_
		* _**Notes (mostly empty)**_
		* _**Check Dec 2016**_
		* _**Sample Date**_
		* _**Observers**_
		* tree.ba.sq.cm (**Now BA**) - NO LONGER MEAURED -

Why are we now doing the 5 year interval starting 2011?  
Any specific reasons why we are start to collect the additional attributes?
Also greater among of specimen are being recording for subsequent inventory. Any reasons why?

## Ground Cover Data

The ground cover data is for 2011 and 2016. _**We REALLY need the metadata for these files to be able to make better informed decisions and ask better questions of the data**_

* 2011 

	* 6115 specimen were collected and recorded on the following attributes
		* Transect number
		* Plot number
		* Corner or Plot Corner
		* Genus
		* Species or Specific epithet
		* Abiotic/Biotic
		* 0-1
		* 1-2
		* 2-3
		*  3-4
		* 4-5
		* Sum of cover (cm)
		* % Coverage
		*Personnel
		* Date
		* Comment

* 2016 

	* 6247 specimen were collected and recorded on the following attributes
		* Transect number
		* Plot number
		* Corner(**Now Plot Corner**)
		* Genus
		* Species(**Specific epithet**)
		* 0-1
		* 1-2
		* 2-3
		*  3-4
		* 4-5
		*Personnel (**Now Observers**)
		* Date (**Now Sample Date**)
		* Comment (**Comments**)  
    
# 2. Restoration Data
## Forest Management

The restoration data was collected over a period of roughly 6 year from November 5,2008 to December 31,2014.
The data sheet contains a lot of data. From initial analysis the focus of the data is what is considered invasive plants species in the United States.  

* The NoteBook Entry tab appears to be recording all of the forest management activity  and series tasks performed over the period of time aforementioned. 

	_Without a comprehensive metadata documentation, the review of this particular spreadsheet is daunting. Also due the amount of data presented, the following tabs in the spreadsheet appears to give a good solid look at the data_   

*  
	* Summary tab - Shows the hours put into the forest management effort at a high level
	* Summary Graphs 2008 - Shows the hours put into the forest management effort for specific forest management effort year over year ( Invasive plant management, Trail Maintenance, Restoration Planting, Pesticide applications)
	* Grid Specific Summary for the specific species monitored over the years
		* [Allaria petiolata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliaria_petiolata) - Herbaceous, non woody
		* [Aralia elata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aralia_elata) - Deciduous small tree/shrub (Woody plant)
		* [Fallopia japonica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallopia_japonica) - Also called Japanese knotweed and it's non woody
		* [Hedera helix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedera_helix) - Hedera helix is an evergreen climbing plant, growing to 20–30 m (66–98 ft) high where suitable surfaces (trees, cliffs, walls) are available, and also growing as groundcover where no vertical surfaces occur.
		* [Lonicera japonica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonicera_japonica) - Also known as Japanese honeysuckle. It's a vine
		* [Lonicera maackia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonicera_maackii)  - Lonicera maackii is enumerated as an endangered species in Japan. It has escaped from cultivation and naturalized in New Zealand and the eastern United States; in the woodlands of the latter it is a significant invasive species. The plant is a large, deciduous shrub 
		* [Phellodendron amurense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phellodendron_amurense) - commonly called the Amur cork tree. The Amur cork tree is considered invasive in many parts of North America. The State of Massachusetts lists it as a noxious weed.

Takeaways -  Every year that there seems to be significant decrease in the hours spent in management, exponentially larger amount of hours seem to be necessary in following years to try to get invasive species under control. Consistency in management is paramount for a successful forest management program.
