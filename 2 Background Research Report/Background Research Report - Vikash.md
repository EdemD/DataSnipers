# Background Research Report

#### 3. The kind of decisions, interventions, or actions that analysis results could support (e.g., management actions, advocacy for policy changes, etc.)

The New York Botanical Garden is the largest uncut expanse of New York's wooden landscape (NYBG, Retrieved 2018). The garden manages invasive species, native plants and performs research on them. Event though, the forest has remained intact since the ice age, it has undergone many changes due to disturbances from the nature as well as human intervention. 

The forest was originally known as 'Hemlock Grove' because the eastern stand, closest to the Bronx River was dominated by the Canadian Hemlock (NYBG/125, 2016). In 1923, it was observed that that there is a decrease in natural regeneration of the Canadian Hemlock (Tsuga canadensis). Later in 1985, Hurricane Gloria introduced the Hemlock Wooly Adelgid (Adelges tsugae), which infected the forest to further decease the density of the native species. 

The recent changes (1937 to 2018) in the forest has been well documented and hence has helped in studying the factors that have lead to the decrease in the native species. The invasive species have also been well studied and managed by the Forest Management. There has been efforts to restore the forest, and to manage the overall ecosystem to prevent the invasive species from becoming the dominant species. 

> By studying this data we aim to draw the inference between the restoration initiatives and its impact on the forest composition over time.

From the raw data of 2002 and 2006, it was found out that there was a prominent increase in the number of invasive species - Amur Cocktree (Phellodendron amurense), Japanese angelica tree (Aralia elata) and Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii). Since 2008, the Garden has been actively managing these species in order to reduce their impact on the overall ecosystem (NYBG/125, 2016).

> We aim to analyze the change in the number of the controlled invasive species after the intervention of the Garden management, to see if there is a correlation between the two.

Over time, the large openings created by hurricanes, supported the growth of shade intolerant species, where as smaller openings prompted the growth of shade tolerant species. Similarly, there have been other influences which has led a small but important change in the composition of the NYBG Forest.

> We want to study the Canopy changes over the year, to analyze the traits that have led to the survival of a particular species over the others which have reduced in numbers.

Tsuga canadensis and Quercus spp. were the most important species in both 1937 and 1985. There has been an increase in the number of stems in the category 15 cm - 30 cm over the past 48 years (Rudnicky and McDonnell, 1989). In case of T. Canadensis, there has been a significant restoration process that might have impacted the growth. But, what about the species that have prevailed over time with minimal intervention.

> We want to analyze the species that have prevailed during the research period, irrespective of the intervention by the Garden Management. If possible, we would also try to find the factors that may have resulted in this behavior.

In the same 48 year time period it was also observed that the canopy structure of the NYBG Forest has changed from the being dominated by taller trees to now being dominated by shorter ones (Rudnicky and McDonnell, 1989). This period also recorded multiple hurricanes which might be the cause for this behavior. There were hurricanes in 1938, 1944 and 1950, and the taller trees were blown away. Event though there are no records of the forest structure during that period, we might be able to compare the 1937 data with the 2002 data to see traces of the impact of the phenomenon.

> We would be analyzing the change in forest structure pre and post the recorded hurricanes, i.e. 1937 data and the 2002 data, and would try to see the variation of taller trees during this period.

Between 2008 and 2015, the director of NYBG developed an ambitious program of ecological restoration, trail restoration and other programs. There were full time positions of dedicated to restoration activities which included removal of invasive species, planting native species grown from locally collected seeds, managing invasive pests and diseases and restoring the habitat (Schuler and Forrest, 2016). The forest staffs, contractors, and volunteers dedicated a substantial amount of time ~ 24000 hours from 2008 to 2014. 

> We want to analyze the staff hours distribution during this period, and the impact it had towards the area of - restoration planting, invasive plant management and trail maintenance.
