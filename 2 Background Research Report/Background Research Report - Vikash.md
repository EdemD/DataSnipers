# Background Research Report

#### 3. The kind of decisions, interventions, or actions that analysis results could support (e.g., management actions, advocacy for policy changes, etc.)

The New York Botanical Garden is the largest uncut expanse of New York's wooden landscape (NYBG, Retrieved 2018). The garden manages invasive species, native plants and performs research on them. Event though, the forest has remained intact since the ice age, it has undergone many changes due to disturbances from the nature as well as human intervention. 

The forest was originally known as 'Hemlock Grove' because the eastern stand, closest to the Bronx River was dominated by the Canadian Hemlock (NYBG/125, 2016). In 1923, it was observed that that there is a decrease in natural regeneration of the Canadian Hemlock (Tsuga canadensis). Later in 1985, Hurricane Gloria introduced the Hemlock Wooly Adelgid (Adelges tsugae), which infected the forest to further decease the density of the native species. 

The recent changes (1937 to 2018) in the forest has been well documented and hence has helped in studying the factors that have lead to the decrease in the native species. The invasive species have also been well studied and managed by the Forest Management. There has been efforts to restore the forest, and to manage the overall ecosystem to prevent the invasive species from becoming the dominant species. 

> By studying this data we aim to draw the inference between the restoration initiatives and its impact on the forest composition over time.

From the raw data of 2002 and 2006, it was found out that there was a prominent increase in the number of invasive species - Amur Cocktree (Phellodendron amurense), Japanese angelica tree (Aralia elata) and Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii). Since 2008, the Garden has been actively managing these species in order to reduce their impact on the overall ecosystem (NYBG/125, 2016).

> We aim to analyze the change in the number of the controlled invasive species after the intervention of the Garden management, to see if there is a correlation between the two.

Over time, the large openings created by hurricanes, supported the growth of shade intolerant species, where as smaller openings prompted the growth of shade tolerant species. Similarly, there have been other influences which has led a small but important change in the composition of the NYBG Forest.

> We want to study the Canopy changes over the year, to analyze the traits that have led to the survival of a particular species over the others which have reduced in numbers.

Tsuga canadensis and Quercus spp. were the most important species in both 1937 and 1985. There has been an increase in the number of stems in the category 15 cm - 30 cm over the past 48 years (Rudnicky and McDonnell, 1989). In case of T. Canadensis, there has been a significant restoration process that might have impacted the growth. But, what about the species that have prevailed over time with minimal intervention.

> We want to analyze the species that have prevailed during the research period, irrespective of the intervention by the Garden Management. If possible, we would also try to find the factors that may have resulted in this behavior.

The species like A. rubrum and P. serotina  were nearly absent from the 1930 survey and were later found predominant in the 15-30 cm size class.
