## <u>The Study of Organism and Phenomenon</u>

### <u>Introduction:</u>

Thain Family Forest at the New York Botanical Garden (NYBG) is located in Bronx, New York. The forest is a 50-acre plot of trees and is recorded as the largest surviving old-growth forest remnant (https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/thain-family-forest). Since the year 1895, when the New York Botanical Garden was first set up, the forest has undergone many changes, for instance, in the earlier days, the forest was known as "Hemlock Grove" due to the larger concentration of a particular kind of plant type called Canadian Hemlock. However, the concentration of Canadian Hemlock stared decreasing, when they compared the growth from the northern forest, in the year 1923. Since then, the observers has registered the decline of the growth of Canadian Hemlock from the data entries of years 1937, 2002, 2006 and 2011. This was one such instance of growth change documented by the team of observers in New York Botanical Garden.

### <u>Project Goals</u>:

1. The objective of this project is to understand the impact of climate change on the forest
2. Document the changes to compare the results with the data set of previous years
3. Understanding the impact of invasive species on the native species

### <u>New York Botanical Garden Project</u>:

The study done by New York Botanical Garden (NYBG) is a study of both organisms and phenomenon. As the project revolves around the studying the nature of trees, herbs, shrubs, vines and on recording the impact of the change in climatic conditions as well as other factors such as increase in population density and decrease in forest areas. The project's objective is to restore the forest. They are using various techniques to help gather the records and maintain them. They also take help from volunteers who can forest conservation enthusiasts, who volunteers to observe the forest areas and document their observations. This program is known as **"Citizen Science Program"** https://www.nybg.org/plant-research-and-conservation/center-for-conservation-strategy/get-involved/. 

### <u>Initial Analysis</u>:

Based on the initial analysis of data, we were able to conclude that the facility has been collecting data starting from year 2002. The data they shared was of years 2002, 2006, 2011 and 2016. The data is gathered for Woody Plants, Comprehensive Species and Other Species that can be either invasive or native species. NYBG also have data set from year 1932. With the help of the observations they were able to draw some conclusions. NYBG has provided various references where they have explained he impacts of climate change and other factors.

#### 1. <u>Publication and Research</u>: 

1. In the report, Torreya Forty -eight years of canopy change in hardwood-hemlock forest in New York City. James L. Rudnicky and Mark J. McDonnell. Institute of Ecosystem Studies, NYBG. were able to present the conclusions from various researchers who suggested that in 1982, the composition of the Thain forest compared to 1949 and 1980 vegetation data from Greenbrook Sanctuary, Hoboken NJ found out that major community of plants - oaks, hemlock-hardwood and swamp-hardwood similar in composition. However, the canopy from year 1980 was more homogeneous s comapred to 1949. The author at last concluded that the forest was undergoing  changes to recover from the disturbance to become more uniform. 

They were able to understand the impact. However, they failed to understand the pattern of the change.

2. The another study was conducted and documented in year 1974, where they studied the impact of temperature impact on the areas of the forest. For example - the climate in the summer is warm and humid, cold during winters. The study was done in Central Park Observatory that is situated at 10 miles south to NYBG. The Average annual temperature is 12. 5 degree Celsius.

During the year of 1930s the study was subjected to numerous errors in the observations recorded.
