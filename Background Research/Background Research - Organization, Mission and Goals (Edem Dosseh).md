# Background Research Report ## New York Botanical Garden: The Organization, its mission and goals### Organization:The New York Botanical Garden (NYBG) is a National Historical Landmark located in the Bronx, New York City. The site covers 250 acre which is a landscape that supports a diverse flora of millions of plants. (Mission and History, n.d.)According the NYBG official website; “the New York Botanical Garden is an iconic living museum, a major educational institution, and a renowned plant research and conservation organization. Founded in 1891 and now a National Historic Landmark, it is one of the greatest botanical gardens in the world and the largest in any city in the United States, distinguished by the beauty of its diverse landscape and extensive collections and gardens, as well as by the scope and excellence of its multidisciplinary exhibitions and programs.” (About, n.d.)NYBG is committed truly committed to the local communities. Throughout the year the garden participate in innovative exhibitions and have several free visitor attractions.  For instance, every year in the spring, the Garden  has  “The Orchid Show, the country’s largest curated exhibition of orchids”. In the winter, they have the “Holiday Train Show” which is “a display of 150 landmarks such as the Brooklyn Bridge, Statue of Liberty, and Rockefeller Center, each re-created with bark, leaves, and other natural materials” (Arts & Humanities, n.d.).  Furthermore the garden is very committed to educating the public which enhance the visitor’s experience. “These include music and dance performances; daily tours; home gardening demonstrations; poetry readings; special lectures and symposia; summer concerts; weekend celebrations such as the Daffodil Wine Weekend, Mother’s Day Weekend Garden Party, and Rose Garden Celebration; and evening events, including Orchid Evenings and Bar Car Nights.” (Arts & Humanities, n.d.).According the NYGB website; their “Adult Education Program is the largest and most diverse continuing education program at any botanical garden in the world, with annual registrations exceeding 9,400 and more than 700 classes offered at the Botanical Garden, the Midtown Education Center in Manhattan, and off-site locations in Dutchess County and Connecticut.” (Arts & Humanities, n.d.) . The Garden also has a nationally accredited School of Professional Horticulture, established in 1932 which offers a two-year, full-time diploma program in horticulture, botany, and landscape design, including native plants, green roofs, urban agriculture, sustainability, greenhouse management, and ecological garden design. (Arts & Humanities, n.d.)  ### Mission: “The New York Botanical Garden is an advocate for the plant kingdom. The Garden pursues its mission through its role as a museum of living plant collections arranged in gardens and landscapes across its National Historic Landmark site; through its comprehensive education programs in horticulture and plant science; and through the wide-ranging research programs of the International Plant Science Center”. (Mission and History, n.d.)### Goals:  “On May 24, 1895 the northern portion of Bronx Park was chosen as the site of the Garden. In 1898, the first checklist of plants living on the Grounds was published in the Journal of The New York Botanical Garden.” (Natural History of the Forest, n.d.)The goal of the NYBG has been, since its humble beginnings, to save the plants of the world. Per the Garden website: “NYBG pursues science-based plant conservation, providing fundamental research to support policy decisions made by governments on local, national, and international scales. Its efforts have helped to protect some of the most threatened floras in the world.” (Saving the Plants of the World, n.d.). With the current state of our world’s ecology, NYBG is committed to saving the plants worldwide by scaling up its conservation action. The Garden has scientists that are in “250 international collaborations with 168 institutions in 49 countries” (Saving the Plants of the World, n.d.); an enormous conservation commitment and undertaking. Since its inception, “the Garden staff, visiting experts, and enthusiastic members of the public have studied the history, wildlife, plant life, geology, climate, soils, and ecology of the Garden. All of these studies have been performed separately and have never been documented in one place. As part of the new Forest Program, Garden staff and visiting experts are creating a Natural History of The New York Botanical Garden to document the physical setting, biota, ecology, management, and ethnobotany of the site. The site is defined as all natural areas within the Garden including the Forest, Twin Lakes, South Arboretum, portion of land between the Rose Garden and Bronx River Parkway perimeter fence, rock outcrops, etc. The goal is to study spontaneous nature at the Garden.” (Natural History of the Forest, n.d.)This is one of the reason why the Garden has the Thain Family Forest Conversation Program. According to the NYBG website; “the Thain Family Forest is a living laboratory that has several ongoing research projects with the goals of understanding the impacts of the urban environment on the Forest and evaluating ecological restoration projects. Research in the Forest is conducted by staff, students, and volunteers.” (Forest Program Research, n.d.)According to Jessica Schuler (Director of the New York Botanical Garden), the Thain Family urban forest is an old growth forest. An old growth forest, (Old-growth forest, 2018) “is a forest that has attained great age without major disturbance and there has unique ecological characteristics.” (Old-growth forest, 2018). It’s also called “virgin” forest or “primeval” forest”. For a several years now, since 1937 in some cases, the Garden has been conducted some restoration work in the forest alongside with other forest management activities as well. The Forest Inventory Transect Study which data we are reviewing, involves data collection since 2001. According to the Garden website; “Garden staff have been sampling fourteen, 10-meter wide transects across the Forest from the western boundary to the Bronx River. The data collected includes all trees and shrubs that are 1 cm or greater in diameter at breast height (DBH at 4.5 feet) and herbaceous plants and tree seedling percent cover.” (Forest Program Research, n.d.)The Garden, while gleaning into the data they have been collecting, is interesting in knowing whether or not there are changes to the inventory which consists of data collected about the woody plant in the forest, as well ground cover species. Additionally, there is a systematic effort in place to track invasive plant management, and to help prioritize ongoing restoration work such as native plant restoration. Results from 2011 data according to the Garden official site show that “the Amur honeysuckle and Amur corktree management has been successful in removing the largest specimens but, there are still small Amur corktree present in the Forest. The biggest focus of management recently was derived from these data, the Japanese angelica tree is currently on the rise and the Forest staff is focusing management efforts on this species.” (Forest Program Research, n.d.)#### ReferencesAbout.
