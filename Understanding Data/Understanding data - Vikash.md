# Understanding Data

## 1. INVENTORY DATA

### 1.1. Comprehensive Species Tally

**Years Available -** 1937, 2002, 2006, 2011, 2016

**Type-** Raw Data

**Summary**

> From the tab 'COMBINED' we can get if a particular species was

### 1.6. Species Code Master List

**Type-** Metadata

The Tab 'Master Spp. List' provides the following mapping-

* Common Names
* Scientific Names
* Plant Feature (Herb, Non-living, Shrub, Shrub/vine, Tree, Vine)

## 2. RESTORATION DATA

### 2.2. Forest Restoration Planting (2007-2018)

**Type-** Raw Data

This worksheet has the information on the restoration initiatives by the NYBG since 2007 till 2018. On a higher level it provides -

> Quantity, Species, Plant Type (Herb, Shrub, Tree), Height, Location, Grid, Date Planted

for the plants planted.

**Potential Inferences that can be drawn**

1. How restoration of the plants have impacted the overall growth from 2007 to 2018.
2. How a specific species which was at the brink of extinction flourished due to the restoration efforts.
3. The change in ratio of primitive species VS invasive species, due to restoration process
4. Number of species which had significant difference due to the efforts.
5. Number of species, which did not get much affected by the restoration efforts.
6. Trend of species which were not a part of restoration process
7. Trend of species which have been impacted by the restoration process (can be a duplicate)
8. The different types of species in the restoration process

### 2.4. Updated FMP Charts

**Type-** Analysis

**fig 1** - Staff and Volunteer Hours by Years (2008-2012) and type of job (restoration planning, trail maintenance, invasive plant management)

**fig 2** - Canopy Change (A canopy is the aboveground portion of a plant formed by the collection of individual plant crowns) - Number of plots VS Canopy Type (1937 - 2011)

**fig 3** - Comparison of living stems between 2006 and 2011 in terms of Density and Frequency? (Unclear)

**fig 4** - Staff and Contractor Hours  by Year (2008-2014) and by plant species.

**fig 5** - Pie chart of Leaf Pack - Tolerant, Intolerant, Semi-tolerant. (Doubt)
