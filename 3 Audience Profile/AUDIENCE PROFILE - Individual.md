**Interests & focus**: 

1. **Study of Invasive Species**: The invasive species has been seen as a threat to the native species. Also, invasive species is considered as one of the top three threats to the ecosystem where they are found to have made their shelter. Jessica is looking for efficient ways to understand the nature of these invasive species and how we can prevent these species from harming our ecosystem. In Lower Hudson Region only, the scientists found 147 invasive species of plants. NYBG and  Lower Hudson Partnership for Regional Invasive Species Management (LHPRISM) has partnered to identify, monitor and share their understanding regarding the invasive species. In August 10, 2017, NYBG hosted a Citizen Science Training Workshop for LHPRISM 2017 BlockBuster Survey. Their aim was to educate 22 volunteer to identify the invasive specie that NYBG had limited about, by assigning a 3 miles of area.

2. **Ecological Restoration**: The large scale ecological restoration project to restore the Thain Family Forest began in 2008. The aim is to improve and manage the forest. With the help of staff and volunteers, the forest is being protected from the dangerous invasive species. They were able to plant thousands of native plants and trees in 50-acres of the forest. By increasing the number of native species they are trying to restore the habitat of the forest. There are numerous organizations that are working to improve the forest health, namely -

   - Lower Hudson Partnership for Regional Invasive Species Management (LHPRISM) 
   - Environmental Monitoring and Management Alliance of the Hudson Valley
   - Society for Ecological Restoration
   - Ecological Restoration Alliance of Botanic Gardens (ERABG)
