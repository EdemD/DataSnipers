New York Botanical Garden (2005 - Present)

- Director of Thain Family Forest (2009 - Present)
- Curator of Woody Plants (2005 - 2009)

#### Educational Background

- Graduate Certificate in Conservation Science - Fordham University, New York (2009 - 2011)
- Bachelor's Degree in Plant Sciences - Cornell University, Ithaca, New York (2002 - 2004)

#### Interests & focus

1. **Study of Invasive Species**: The invasive species has been seen as a threat to the native species. Also, invasive species is considered as one of the top three threats to the ecosystem where they are found to have made their shelter. Jessica is looking for efficient ways to understand the nature of these invasive species and how we can prevent these species from harming our ecosystem. In Lower Hudson Region only, the scientists found 147 invasive species of plants. NYBG and  Lower Hudson Partnership for Regional Invasive Species Management (LHPRISM) has partnered to identify, monitor and share their understanding regarding the invasive species. In August 10, 2017, NYBG hosted a Citizen Science Training Workshop for LHPRISM 2017 BlockBuster Survey. Their aim was to educate 22 volunteer to identify the invasive specie that NYBG had limited about, by assigning a 3 miles of area.

2. **Ecological Restoration**: The large scale ecological restoration project to restore the Thain Family Forest began in 2008. The aim is to improve and manage the forest. With the help of staff and volunteers, the forest is being protected from the dangerous invasive species. They were able to plant thousands of native plants and trees in 50-acres of the forest. By increasing the number of native species they are trying to restore the habitat of the forest. There are numerous organizations that are working to improve the forest health, namely -

   - Lower Hudson Partnership for Regional Invasive Species Management (LHPRISM) 

   - Environmental Monitoring and Management Alliance of the Hudson Valley

   - Society for Ecological Restoration

   - Ecological Restoration Alliance of Botanic Gardens (ERABG)


## Organizational





## Both Individual and Organization

### Data Capabilities (maturity/literacy)

The management at New York Botanical Garden have been actively monitoring the forest growth and changes since the year 2002. They also have retrieved the historic data from the research in 1937. The type of data they have been capturing includes -

* Data from the restoration planting done between the year 2008 to 2018.
* Staff and Volunteer efforts (in hours) towards the tasks - restoration planning, trail maintenance, invasive plant management, etc.
* Canopy Change by plots from the year 1937 to 2011.
* Comparison of living stems between 2006 and 2011 in terms of Density and Frequency.
* Data on the leaf pack - tolerant, intolerant, semi-tolerant.
* The specimen and its location by plot number.

### Requirements / Needs

The organization has several initiatives that are currently in progress. They want to encourage natural ecosystem processes and mitigate the anthropogenic (originating from human activities) disturbances. They want to promote the natural regeneration of native species with minimal human intervention. They want to study how urbanization of surrounding areas have affected the forest health. They want to spread the knowledge about the forest life and the need to conserve the species. They want to inspire the volunteers, students and interns in all aspects of research, stewardship, and education.

Forest ecosystems are characterized by constant change, therefore they want to constantly assess and adapt to the new threats as they arise. Ultimately, they want to protect the Forest's unique flora, fauna and ecosystem processes while ensuring that it continues to be safe, accessible and inspiring to Garden visitors, researchers, and educators for generations to come (Schuler and Forrest, 2016).

### Priorities

Towards the requirement, the management has prioritized the following goals for 2016-2015.

1. Improve Forest Health
2. Maintain and Improve Trails
3. Engage and educate new audiences
4. Expand research and citizen science
5. Document and enhance biodiversity
6. Cultivate new partnerships
