## Both Individual and Organization

### Data Capabilities (maturity/literacy)

The management at New York Botanical Garden have been actively monitoring the forest growth and changes since the year 2002. They also have retrieved the historic data from the research in 1937. The type of data they have been capturing includes -

* Data from the restoration planting done between the year 2008 to 2018.
* Staff and Volunteer efforts (in hours) towards the tasks - restoration planning, trail maintenance, invasive plant management, etc.
* Canopy Change by plots from the year 1937 to 2011.
* Comparison of living stems between 2006 and 2011 in terms of Density and Frequency.
* Data on the leaf pack - tolerant, intolerant, semi-tolerant.
* The specimen and its location by plot number.

### Requirements / Needs

The organization has several initiatives that are currently in progress. They want to encourage natural ecosystem processes and mitigate the anthropogenic (originating from human activities) disturbances. They want to promote the natural regeneration of native species with minimal human intervention. They want to study how urbanization of surrounding areas have affected the forest health. They want to spread the knowledge about the forest life and the need to conserve the species. They want to inspire the volunteers, students and interns in all aspects of research, stewardship, and education.

Forest ecosystems are characterized by constant change, therefore they want to constantly assess and adapt to the new threats as they arise. Ultimately, they want to protect the Forest's unique flora, fauna and ecosystem processes while ensuring that it continues to be safe, accessible and inspiring to Garden visitors, researchers, and educators for generations to come (Schuler and Forrest, 2016).

### Priorities

Towards the requirement, the management has prioritized the following goals for 2016-2015.

1. Improve Forest Health
2. Maintain and Improve Trails
3. Engage and educate new audiences
4. Expand research and citizen science
5. Document and enhance biodiversity
6. Cultivate new partnerships
